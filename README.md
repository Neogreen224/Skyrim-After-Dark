Skyrim After Dark is a passion project with it's primary focus being NSFW. In my time in modding skyrim I noticed there was not alot of NSFW mod lists that were active or being updated regularly. I plan to keep this mod lists up to date as long as the community continues to support it. 

Skyrim After Darks goal is to be the best graphical looking NSFW experience possible without being too taxing on your system, and more optimized to reduce crashes or issues. 

This modlist will also contain tons of new quests, every armor pack possible, weapons, tons of customization options, and meant to be the best NSFW experience with tons of content to enjoy. 

System Requirements


⚠️ ❗ Skyrim After Dark REQUIRES YOUR SKYRIM VERSION TO BE UPDATED TO 1.6.1170 AND THIS IS THE GAME VERSION THAT THE MODLIST RUNS ON. YOU ALSO NEED FULL ANNIVERSARY EDITION ($20 UPGRADE) ❗ ⚠️

Only, Windows 10 and 11 work with Wabbajack fully. LTSC, special variants, lightened editions or any other modified variant WILL NOT WORK. Your windows version must be 21H2 or newer to run both Wabbajack and Skyrim After Dark.

Running the list from Hard Disk Drives or external drives is STRONGLY ADVISED AGAINST. A lot of content is swapped at game run time and, as a result, fast storage and RAM are needed.

Recommended System Requirements
Skyrim After Dark requires a mid-tier modern system to run to its fullest potential. The recommended specs given below are based on utilizing the ENB in the list. For community shaders, you can subtract a little bit from them. Users have reported being able to run on hardware slightly lower than this, however your mileage may vary.

Installation
Installing Skyrim After Dark is relatively easy and, if you have Nexus Premium, will be a simple waiting game. If you are updating the modlist, you can safely skip to the updating section.

Pre-Installation
Prior to installing Skyrim After Dark, please complete the following steps.

Install Visual C++ x64 & .Net Runtime v5 desktop x64
Change Skyrim so it does not automatically update.
Make sure your Skyrim Steam installation is updated to the latest version (1.6.1170) and set to the English language. I HIGHLY recommend not installing Steam, Skyrim or any modlist into your Program Files.
Fully disable OneDrive and any other programs which hook into user file areas.
Launch the game to the main menu and allow it to download the AE creation club addon files. DO NOT VERIFY YOUR GAME FILES, DO NOT ALT TAB If you already verified, go to step 6.
If you get a curios or other cc error, go into your Skyrim Steam installation "Data" folder and delete ALL files beginning with "cc". Then relaunch the game and re-download the creation club content. DO NOT ALT TAB
Remove/Disable any 3rd party antivirus such as MalwareBytes or Webroot. These will mess with the installation and, in the case of the latter, causes more problems than it solves.

Wabbajack Installation
Installing Wabbajack
Once you have completed pre-installation, download the latest version of Wabbajack and place it in a folder such as C:\Games\Wabbajack. Do not place it in program files, on your desktop or in your downloads folder. I recommend placing it on an SSD as it will work quicker on there.

⚠️ NOTE: Skyrim After Dark will always require the latest version of Wabbajack UNLESS IT IS SPECIFICALLY STATED HERE. ⚠️

Downloading and Installing Skyrim After Dark
Downloading and installing Skyrim After Dark can take a while depending on your internet connection and computer. To install Skyrim After Dark, complete the following steps.

Open Wabbajack and click on browse modlists.
Press the download button on Skyrim After Dark and wait for it to download.
Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\Skyrim After Dark. Do not install it to your desktop or downloads folder.
The download location does not need to be on a SSD but it makes installing a bit faster.
Press the play button to begin.
If the installation is successful, jump for joy and move onto post installation. If the installation is unsuccessful, follow what is below.
Problems with installation
It is possible that you may encounter an error with Wabbajack when installing. Some common issues are listed below.

Could not download x:

Big files can fail to download due to connection issues. You can either run Wabbajack again or download the file manually. If you decide to manually download it, make sure to place it in the same place as the other downloads.
Make sure you have downloaded all the AE update content!

x is not a whitelisted download:

This will happen when I update the modlist. Please check if there is a new update or wait until you see a release ping.
Wabbajack could not find my game folder:

Either buy the game or go back to the Pre-Installation step.
Antivirus reports a virus:

You did not follow the steps in Pre-Installation. Go back and follow it.
If you have followed it then you can fix this by adding an exclusion for Mod Organizer in Windows Defender.
Post-Installation
Stock Game & Root Builder
Skyrim After Dark utilizes a Wabbajack technology called Stock Game. What this essentially does is create a copy of your Skyrim installation within the installation location of the list. This enables greater compatibility with other mod-lists.

Skyrim After Dark also utilizes Root Builder alongside Stock Game to enable easier management of hooks such as ENB, Reshade and Engine Fixes. Please see our guide to Root Builder for more details.

NOTE: Screenshots save to Overwrite\Stock Game.

Starting up the list
Open the installation folder and double-click on the program called ModOrganizer.exe.

Make sure the dropdown box on the right is set to Skyrim After Dark and press the Run button.

In-game MCM options
Skyrim After Dark has no required MCM options to be selected; however, you can load the smoothcam preset if you wish to do so.

You are welcome to change any others to achieve your desired setup.

Updating the modlist
Before updating, please check the changelog and back up your saves. You may need to start a new game after certain updates.

Updating is like installing the list. Simply make sure your paths are the same and tick the overwrite existing modlist button. Note: Any mods you have added will be deleted when updating.

Removing the Modlist
Simply delete the folder, and you have uninstalled it.
